# Website Loading Perception Test

A web application for testing users' perception of the loading speed of a website. Users click the button when they see the model that appears, and then evaluate the download speed.

## Notes

- Results **are NOT** shown to respondents (only a completion message)
- All data is logged in the browser console (F12) for verification by the administrator
- Results are saved to localStorage by default (or sent to API if they are configured)
- No external dependencies are required for basic functionality.
- Fully responsive design works on devices of any size.
